# React Router

The `react-router` package is the heart of [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) and provides all the core functionality.

If you'd like to extend React Router and you know what you're doing, you should
add `react-router` **as a peer dependency, not a regular dependency** in your
package.
