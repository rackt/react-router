# history

The `history` library lets you easily manage session history anywhere JavaScript runs. A `history` object abstracts away the differences in various environments and provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, and persist state between sessions.

This internal package is an evolution of the [`history`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history) `npm` package from https://github.com/remix-run/history, and has now been internalized to `react-router`.
