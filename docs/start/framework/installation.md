# Installation

Most projects start with a template. Let's use a basic template maintained by React Router:

```shellscript nonumber
npm create react-router@pre my-react-router-app
```

Now change into the new directory and start the app

```shellscript nonumber
cd my-react-router-app
npm i
npm run dev
```

You can now open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

You can [view the template on GitHub](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/templates/basic) to see how to manually set up your project.
