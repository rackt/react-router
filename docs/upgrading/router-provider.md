# Framework Adoption from RouterProvider

If you are not using `<RouterProvider>` please see [Framework Adoption from Component Routes][upgrade-component-routes] instead.

The React Router Vite plugin adds framework features to React Router. This guide will help you adopt the plugin in your app. If you run into any issues, please reach out for help on [Twitter](https://x.com/remix_run) or [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord).

## Features

The Vite plugin adds:

- Route loaders, actions, and automatic data revalidation
- Typesafe Routes Modules
- Automatic route code-splitting
- Automatic scroll restoration across navigations
- Optional Static pre-rendering
- Optional Server rendering

The initial setup will require the most work, but once complete, adopting the new features is incremental, you can do one route at a time.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the Vite plugin, your project needs to be running

- Node.js 20+ (if using Node as your runtime)
- Vite 5+

## 1. Install the Vite plugin

**ðŸ‘‰ Install the React Router Vite plugin**

```shellscript nonumber
npm install -D @react-router/dev
```

**ðŸ‘‰ Install a runtime adapter**

We will assume you are using Node as your runtime

```shellscript nonumber
npm install @react-router/node
```

**ðŸ‘‰ Swap out the React plugin for React Router**

```diff filename=vite.config.ts
-import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
+import { reactRouter } from "@react-router/dev/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";


export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
-    react()
+    reactRouter()
  ],
});
```

## 2. Add the React Router config

**ðŸ‘‰ Create a `react-router.config.ts` file**

Add the following to the root of your project. In this config you can tell React Router about your project, like where to find the app directory and to not use SSR (server-side rendering) for now.

```shellscript nonumber
touch react-router.config.ts
```

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  appDirectory: "src",
  ssr: false,
} satisfies Config;
```

## 3. Add the Root entry point

In a typical Vite app, the `index.html` file is the entry point for bundling. The React Router Vite plugin moves the entry point to a `root.tsx` file so you can use React to render the shell of your app instead of static HTML, and eventually upgrade to Server Rendering if you want.

**ðŸ‘‰ Move your existing `index.html` to `root.tsx`**

For example, if your current `index.html` looks like this:

```html filename=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
    />
    <title>My App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You would move that markup into `src/root.tsx` and delete `index.html`:

```shellscript nonumber
touch src/root.tsx
```

```tsx filename=src/root.tsx
import {
  Links,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "react-router";

export function Layout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
        />
        <title>My App</title>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

export default function Root() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

## 4. Add client entry module

<!-- TODO: from here on out this is wrong, for Brooks to update -->

In the typical Vite app the `index.html` file points to `src/main.tsx` as the client entry point. React Router uses a file named `src/entry.client.tsx` instead.

**ðŸ‘‰ Make `src/entry.client.tsx` your entry point**

If your current `src/main.tsx` looks like this:

```tsx filename=src/main.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
} from "react-router-dom";

const router = createBrowserRouter(YOUR_ROUTES);

ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root")!
).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

You would rename it to `entry.client.tsx` and change it to this:

```tsx filename=src/entry.client.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { HydratedRouter } from "react-router/dom";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.hydrateRoot(
  document,
  <React.StrictMode>
    <HydratedRouter />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

- Use `hydrateRoot` instead of `createRoot`
- Use `<HydratedRouter>` instead of `<RouterProvider>`
- Note: we stopped passing the routes prop for now. We'll bring it back in a later step, but first we want to get the app to boot with the new entry point.

## 5. Shuffle stuff around

Between `root.tsx` and `entry.client.tsx`, you may want to shuffle some stuff around between them.

In general:

- `root.tsx` contains any rendering things like context providers, layouts, styles, etc.
- `entry.client.tsx` should be as minimal as possible
- Remember to _not_ try to pass your existing routes yet, we'll do that in a later step

Note that your `root.tsx` file will be statically generated and served as the entry point of your app, so just that module will need to be compatible with server rendering. This is where most of your trouble will come.

## 6. Setup your routes

The React Router Vite plugin uses a `routes.ts` file to configure your routes. For now we'll add a simple catchall route to get things going.

**ðŸ‘‰ Setup a `catchall.tsx` route**

```shellscript nonumber
touch src/routes.ts src/catchall.tsx
```

```ts filename=src/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  // * matches all URLs, the ? makes it optional so it will match / as well
  route("*?", "catchall.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

**ðŸ‘‰ Render a placeholder route**

Eventually we'll replace this with our original routes, but for now we'll just render something simple to make sure we can boot the app.

```tsx filename=src/catchall.tsx
export default function Component() {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
}
```

[View our guide on configuring routes][configuring-routes] to learn more about the `routes.ts` file.

## 7. Boot the app

At this point you should be able to to boot the app and see the root layout.

**ðŸ‘‰ Add `dev` script and run the app**

```json filename=package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "react-router dev"
}
```

Now make sure you can boot your app at this point before moving on:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## 8. Add your routes

To get back to rendering your routes, we'll update the `routes.ts` file to include your existing routes.

**ðŸ‘‰ Update routes.ts with your existing routes**

```ts filename=src/routes.ts
import {
  type RouteConfig,
  route,
} from "@react-router/dev/routes";

// Convert your existing routes to the new format
export default [
  route("/", "routes/index.tsx"),
  route("/about", "routes/about.tsx"),
  // ... other routes
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Your app should be back on the screen and working as usual!

If you're having trouble

- Comment out the `routes` prop to `<HydratedRouter>` to isolate the problem to the new entry points
- Search the [Upgrading Discussion](#TODO) category
- Reach out for help on [Twitter](https://x.com/remix_run) or [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord)

Make sure you can boot your app at this point before moving on.

## 9. Migrate a route to a Route Module

You can now incrementally migrate your routes to route modules. First create a `routes.ts` file that exports your routes.

Given an existing route like this:

```tsx filename=src/entry.client.tsx
// ...
import Page from "./containers/page";

ReactDOM.hydrateRoot(
  document,
  <StrictMode>
    <HydratedRouter
      routes={[
        // ...
        {
          path: "/pages/:id",
          element: <Page />,
        },
      ]}
    />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

You can move the definition to a `routes.ts` file:

```tsx filename=src/routes.ts
import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
  {
    path: "/pages/:id",
    file: "./containers/page.tsx",
  },
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

And then edit the route module to use the Route Module API:

```tsx filename=src/pages/about.tsx
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router";

export async function clientLoader({ params }) {
  let page = await getPage(params.id);
  return page;
}

export default function Component() {
  let data = useLoaderData();
  return <h1>{data.title}</h1>;
}
```

See [Type Safety][type-safety] to setup autogenerated type safety for params, loader data, and more.

The first few routes you migrate are the hardest because you often have to access various abstractions a bit differently than before (like in a loader instead of from a hook or context). But once the trickiest bits get dealt with, you get into an incremental groove.

## Enable SSR and/or Pre-rendering

If you want to enable server rendering and static pre-rendering, you can do so with the `ssr` and `prerender` options in the bundler plugin. For SSR you'll need to also deploy the server build to a server. See [Deploying][deploying] for more information.

## Enable SSR and Pre-rendering

If you want to enable server rendering and static pre-rendering, you can do so with the `ssr` and `prerender` options in the bundler plugin.

```ts filename=react-router.config.ts
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: true,
  async prerender() {
    return ["/", "/about", "/contact"];
  },
} satisfies Config;
