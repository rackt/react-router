# Upgrading from Remix

<docs-warning>This guide is mostly a stub and in active development, it will be wrong about many things before the final v7 release</docs-warning>

Our intention is for the **Remix v2 -> React Router v7** upgrade path to be as non-breaking as possible via the use of [Future Flags][future-flags] for minor and straightforward code adjustments. To best prepare for this eventual upgrade, you can start by adopting all of the existing [Remix v2 Future Flags][v2-future-flags].

## Upgrading to the v7 Prerelease

If you want to attempt the (potentially rocky) migration now, the following steps should get you most of the way there. If you run into issues please let us know in [Discord][remix-discord] or [Github][github-new-issue].

### Step 1 - Adopt future flags

Adopt all existing [future flags][v2-future-flags] in your Remix v2 application.

### Step 2 - Update dependencies

You can automatically update your packages and imports with a [codemod][codemod] created by community member [James Restall][jrestall]

**üëâ Run the codemod (automated)**

The codemod updates all of your packages and imports. Be sure to commit your changes before running the codemod, in case you need to revert.

```shellscript nonumber
npx codemod remix/2/react-router/upgrade
```

**üëâ Run the codemod**

After the codemod updates your dependencies, you need to go ahead and run your install to remove Remix packages and add the new React Router packages.

<docs-warning>

While still in prerelease, you need to update your `package.json` to point to the prerelease versions of the `react-router` packages.

</docs-warning>

```shellscript nonumber
npm install
```

**üëâ Update your dependencies (manual)**

You'll need to update your dependencies from the `@remix-run/*` packages to `react-router` and `@react-router/*` packages in `package.json` and in your code where you import from packages:

| Remix v2 Package            |     | React Router v7 Package    |
| --------------------------- | --- | -------------------------- |
| `@remix-run/architect`      | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `@react-router/architect`  |
| `@remix-run/cloudflare`     | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `@react-router/cloudflare` |
| `@remix-run/dev`            | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `@react-router/dev`        |
| `@remix-run/express`        | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `@react-router/express`    |
| `@remix-run/node`           | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `@react-router/node`       |
| `@remix-run/react`          | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `react-router`             |
| `@remix-run/serve`          | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `@react-router/serve`      |
| `@remix-run/server-runtime` | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `react-router`             |
| `@remix-run/testing`        | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `react-router`             |

Most of the "shared" APIs that used to be re-exported through the runtime-specific packages (`@remix-run/node`, `@remix-run/cloudflare`, etc.) have all been collapsed into `react-router` in v7. So instead of importing from `@react-router/node` or `@react-router/cloudflare`, you'll import those directly from `react-router`.

```diff
-import { redirect } from "@react-router/node";
+import { redirect } from "react-router";
```

The only APIs you should be importing from the runtime-specific packages in v7 are APIs that are specific to that runtime, such as `createFileSessionStorage` for Node and `createWorkersKVSessionStorage` for Cloudflare.

### Step 3 - Change `scripts` in `package.json`

Update the scripts in your `package.json`:

| Script      | Remix v2                            |     | React Router v7                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `dev`       | `remix vite:dev`                    | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `react-router dev`                         |
| `build`     | `remix vite:build`                  | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `react-router build`                       |
| `start`     | `remix-serve build/server/index.js` | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `react-router-serve build/server/index.js` |
| `typecheck` | `tsc`                               | ‚û°Ô∏è  | `react-router typegen && tsc`              |

### Step 4 - Rename plugin in `vite.config`

Update the import and rename the plugin in your `vite.config.ts`:

```diff
-import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
+import { reactRouter } from "@react-router/dev/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
-   remix({
-     future: {
-       // all future flags adopted
-     },
-   }),
+   reactRouter(),
    tsconfigPaths(),
  ],
});
```

### Step 5 - Add a `routes.ts` file

In React Router v7 you define your routes using the [`app/routes.ts`][routing] file. For backwards-compatibility and for folks who prefer [file-based conventions][fs-routing], you can opt-into the same "flat routes" convention you are using in Remix v2 via the new `@react-router/fs-routes` package:

```ts filename=app/routes.ts
import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";
import { flatRoutes } from "@react-router/fs-routes";

export default flatRoutes() satisfies RouteConfig;
```

### Step 6 - Rename components in entry files

If you have an `entry.server.tsx` and/or an `entry.client.tsx` file in your application, you will need to update the main components in these files:

```diff filename=app/entry.server.tsx
- import { RemixServer } from "@remix-run/react";
+ import { ServerRouter } from "react-router";

- <RemixServer context={remixContext} url={request.url} />,
+ <ServerRouter context={remixContext} url={request.url} />,
```

```diff filename=app/entry.client.tsx
- import { RemixBrowser } from "@remix-run/react";
+ import { HydratedRouter } from "react-router/dom";

hydrateRoot(
  document,
  <StrictMode>
-   <RemixBrowser />
+   <HydratedRouter />
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

### Step 7 - Update types for `AppLoadContext`

<docs-info>If you were using `remix-serve` you can skip this step. This is only applicable if you were using a custom server in Remix v2.</docs-info>

If you were using `getLoadContext` in your Remix app, then you'll notice that the `LoaderFunctionArgs`/`ActionFunctionArgs` types now type the `context` parameter incorrectly (optional and typed as `any`). These types accept a generic for the `context` type but even that still leaves the property as optional because it does not exist in React Router SPA apps.

The proper long term fix is to move to the new [`Route.LoaderArgs`][server-loaders]/[`Route.ActionArgs`][server-actions] types from the [new typegen in React Router v7][type-safety].

However, the short-term solution to ease the upgrade is to use TypeScript's [module augmentation][ts-module-augmentation] feature to override the built in `LoaderFunctionArgs`/`ActionFunctionArgs` interfaces.

You can do this with the following code in your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
// Your AppLoadContext used in v2
interface AppLoadContext {
  whatever: string;
}

// Tell v7 the type of the context and that it is non-optional
declare module "react-router" {
  interface LoaderFunctionArgs {
    context: AppLoadContext;
  }
}
```

This should allow you to upgrade and ship your application on React Router v7, and then you can incrementally migrate routes to the new typegen approach.
