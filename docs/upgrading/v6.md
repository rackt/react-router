# Upgrading from v6

## Future Flags

If you are current on all future flags in v6, the v7 upgrade is non-breaking.

First update to the latest minor version of v6.x and then the console will warn you for any flags that you have not enabled.

```tsx
export interface FutureConfig {
  v7_fetcherPersist: boolean;
  v7_normalizeFormMethod: boolean;
  v7_partialHydration: boolean;
  v7_prependBasename: boolean;
  v7_relativeSplatPath: boolean;
  v7_startTransition: boolean;
}
```

Once you are caught up, you can simply update to the latest version of v7 (theoretically!) without issue.

```shellscript nonumber
npm install react-router-dom@7
```

## Bundler Plugins

The rest of this document is optional. It describes how to incrementally take advantage of the new features in v7 including

- route modules
- automatic code-splitting
- static pre-rendering
- server rendering
- React Server Components

We encourage you to take these steps to set your app up for future React features with React Server Components and Server Actions.

### Vite

First install the React Router vite plugin:

```shellscript nonumber
npm install -D @react-router/vite
```

Then swap out the React plugin for React Router. The `react` key accepts the same options as the React plugin.

```diff filename=vite.config.ts
-import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
+import { plugin as app } from "@react-router/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";


export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
-    react(reactOptions)
+    app({ react: reactOptions })
  ],
});
```

### Webpack

<docs-error>TODO: update this when we know exactly what it looks like</docs-error>

If you are using Webpack, you will need to update your Webpack config to use the React Router plugin.

```shellscript nonumber
npm install -D @react-router/webpack
```

```ts filename=webpack.config.js
import { ReactRouterPlugin } from "@react-router/webpack";
export default {
  plugins: [new ReactRouterPlugin()],
};
```

### Create React App

<docs-error>TODO: update this when we know exactly what it looks like</docs-error>

- Eject and add the Webpack plugin
- Switch to Vite: https://www.robinwieruch.de/vite-create-react-app/

## Entry Points

After configuring the bundler, you'll need to shuffle around your app's entry points.

<docs-error>TODO: add more details here</docs-error>

- Move `index.html` template to `root.tsx`
- Move entry/root component to `root.tsx` and `entry.client.tsx`

## Enable SSR and Pre-rendering

If you want to enable server rendering and static pre-rendering, you can do so with the `ssr` and `prerender` options in the bundler plugin.

```ts filename=vite.config.ts
import { plugin as app } from "@react-router/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    app({
      ssr: true,
      async prerender() {
        return ["/", "/about", "/contact"];
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

See [Deploying][deploying] for more information on deploying a server.

## Route Modules

You can incrementally migrate your routes to route modules.

First create a `routes.ts` file that exports your routes.

```tsx filename=app/routes.ts

```
