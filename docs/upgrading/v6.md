# Upgrading from v6

The v7 upgrade is non-breaking if you are caught up on all future flags. These flags allow you to update your app one change at a time. We highly recommend you make a commit after each step and ship it instead of doing everything all at once.

## Update to latest v6.x

First update to the latest minor version of v6.x to have the latest future flags and console warnings.

ðŸ‘‰ **Update to latest v6**

```shellscript nonumber
npm install react-router-dom@6
```

### v7_relativeSplatPath

**Background**

Changes the relative path matching and linking for multi-segment splats paths like `dashboard/*` (vs. just `*`). [View the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/packages/react-router-dom/CHANGELOG.md#minor-changes-2) for more information.

ðŸ‘‰ **Enable the flag**

Enabling the flag depends on the type of router:

```tsx
<BrowserRouter
  future={{
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true,
  }}
/>
```

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

If you have any routes with a path + a splat like `<Route path="dashboard/*">` and has relative links like `<Link to="relative">` or `<Link to="../relative">` beneath it, you will need to update your code.

ðŸ‘‰ **Split the `<Route>` into two**

Split any multi-segment splat `<Route>` into a parent route with the path and a child route with the splat:

```diff
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
-  <Route path="dashboard/*" element={<Dashboard />} />
+  <Route path="dashboard">
+    <Route path="*" element={<Dashboard />} />
+  </Route>
</Routes>

// or
createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <Home /> },
  {
-    path: "dashboard/*",
-    element: <Dashboard />,
+    path: "dashboard",
+    children: [{ path: "*", element: <Dashboard /> }],
  },
]);
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Update relative links**

Update any `<Link>` elements within that route tree to include the extra `..` relative segment to continue linking to the same place:

```diff
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <nav>
-        <Link to="/">Dashboard Home</Link>
-        <Link to="team">Team</Link>
-        <Link to="projects">Projects</Link>
+        <Link to="../">Dashboard Home</Link>
+        <Link to="../team">Team</Link>
+        <Link to="../projects">Projects</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<DashboardHome />} />
        <Route path="team" element={<DashboardTeam />} />
        <Route
          path="projects"
          element={<DashboardProjects />}
        />
      </Routes>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### v7_startTransition

**Background**

This uses `React.useTransition` instead of `React.useState` for Router state updates. View the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v7_starttransition) for more information.

ðŸ‘‰ **Enable the flag**

```tsx
<BrowserRouter
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
  }}
/>

// or
<RouterProvider
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
  }}
/>
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Update your Code**

You don't need to update anything unless you are using `React.lazy` _inside_ of a component.

Using `React.lazy` inside of a component is incompatible with `React.useTransition` (or other code that makes promises inside of components). Move `React.lazy` to the module scope and stop making promises inside of components. This is not a limitation of React Router but rather incorrect usage of React.

### v7_fetcherPersist

<docs-warning>If you are not using a `<RouterProvider>` you can skip this</docs-warning>

**Background**

The fetcher lifecycle is now based on when it returns to an idle state rather than when its owner component unmounts: [View the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#persistence-future-flag-futurev7_fetcherpersist) for more information.

**Enable the Flag**

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_fetcherPersist: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

It's unlikely to affect your app. You may want to check any usage of `useFetchers` as they may persist longer than they did before. Depending on what you're doing, you may render something longer than before.

### v7_normalizeFormMethod

<docs-warning>If you are not using a `<RouterProvider>` you can skip this</docs-warning>

This normalizes `formMethod` fields as uppercase HTTP methods to align with the `fetch()` behavior. [View the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#futurev7_normalizeformmethod) for more information.

ðŸ‘‰ **Enable the Flag**

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_normalizeFormMethod: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

If any of your code is checking for lowercase HTTP methods, you will need to update it to check for uppercase HTTP methods (or call `toLowerCase()` on it).

ðŸ‘‰ **Compare `formMethod` to UPPERCASE**

```diff
-useNavigation().formMethod === "post"
-useFetcher().formMethod === "get";
+useNavigation().formMethod === "POST"
+useFetcher().formMethod === "GET";
```

### v7_partialHydration

<docs-warning>If you are not using a `<RouterProvider>` you can skip this</docs-warning>

This allows SSR frameworks to provide only partial hydration data. It's unlikely you need to worry about this, just turn the flag on. [View the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#partial-hydration) for more information.

ðŸ‘‰ **Enable the Flag**

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_partialHydration: true,
  },
});
```

### v7_skipActionStatusRevalidation

<docs-warning>If you are not using a `createBrowserRouter` you can skip this</docs-warning>

When this flag is enabled, loaders will no longer revalidate by default after an action throws/returns a `Response` with a `4xx`/`5xx` status code. You may opt-into revalidation in these scenarios via `shouldRevalidate` and the `actionStatus` parameter.

ðŸ‘‰ **Enable the Flag**

```tsx
createBrowserRouter(routes, {
  future: {
    v7_skipActionStatusRevalidation: true,
  },
});
```

**Update your Code**

In most cases, you probably won't have to make changes to your app code. Usually, if an action errors, it's unlikely data was mutated and needs revalidation. If any of your code _does_ mutate data in action error scenarios you have 2 options:

ðŸ‘‰ **Option 1: Change the `action` to avoid mutations in error scenarios**

```js
// Before
async function action() {
  await mutateSomeData();
  if (detectError()) {
    throw new Response(error, { status: 400 });
  }
  await mutateOtherData();
  // ...
}

// After
async function action() {
  if (detectError()) {
    throw new Response(error, { status: 400 });
  }
  // All data is now mutated after validations
  await mutateSomeData();
  await mutateOtherData();
  // ...
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Option 2: Opt-into revalidation via `shouldRevalidate` and `actionStatus`**

```js
async function action() {
  await mutateSomeData();
  if (detectError()) {
    throw new Response(error, { status: 400 });
  }
  await mutateOtherData();
}

async function loader() { ... }

function shouldRevalidate({ actionStatus, defaultShouldRevalidate }) {
  if (actionStatus != null && actionStatus >= 400) {
    // Revalidate this loader when actions return a 4xx/5xx status
    return true;
  }
  return defaultShouldRevalidate;
}
```

## Upgrade to v7

Now that your app is caught up, you can simply update to v7 (theoretically!) without issue.

ðŸ‘‰ **install v7**

```shellscript nonumber
npm install react-router-dom@7
```

Your app should continue to work but we've restructured in v7 so that you can import directly from `"react-router"` â€” we'll do that in the next step.

_Note: If you have issues with the above command, you may need to use the full `7.0.0-pre.N` version number because package managers may not always resolve `@7` to a prerelease since there is no stable 7.x release yet._

ðŸ‘‰ **Uninstall react-router-dom, install react-router**

In v7 we've also combined the `react-router` and `react-router-dom` packages and you can import everything directly from `"react-router"` (with one exception - see below):

```shellscript nonumber
npm uninstall react-router-dom
npm install react-router
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Update imports**

Now you can update you imports to come from `react-router`:

```diff
-import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
+import { useLocation } from "react-router";
```

The one exception to this rule is for exports that specifically require `react-dom` â€” namely `RouterProvider` and `HydratedRouter` which use [`ReactDOM.flushSync`][react-flushsync] internally. These need to come from a separate `package.json` export to avoid peer dependency issues in non-browser apps that don't install `react-dom`. If you're writing a browser-based app, you will want to those from `react-router/dom`:

```js
import { RouterProvider } from "react-router/dom";
```

Instead of manually updating imports, you can use this command. Make sure your git working tree is clean though so you can revert if it doesn't work as expected.

```shellscript nonumber
find ./path/to/src \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) -type f -exec sed -i '' 's|from "react-router-dom"|from "react-router"|g' {} +
```

Congratulations, you're now on v7!
