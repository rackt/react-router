For Remix consumers migrating to React Router, the Vite plugin's `manifest` option has been removed.

The `manifest` option been superseded by the more powerful `buildEnd` hook since it's passed the `buildManifest` argument. You can still write the build manifest to disk if needed, but you'll most likely find it more convenient to write any logic depending on the build manifest within the `buildEnd` hook itself.

If you were using the `manifest` option, you can replace it with a `buildEnd` hook that writes the manifest to disk like this:

```js
import { reactRouter } from "@react-router/dev/vite";
import { writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";

export default {
  plugins: [
    reactRouter({
      async buildEnd({ buildManifest }) {
        await writeFile(
          "build/manifest.json",
          JSON.stringify(buildManifest, null, 2),
          "utf-8"
        );
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```
